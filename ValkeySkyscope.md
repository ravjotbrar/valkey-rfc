# Skyscope RFC

## Abstract

The proposed feature is Skyscope, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that brings observability capabilities to Valkey. Skyscope addresses critical observability and monitoring gaps identified through community analysis and customer research, particularly focusing on hot key detection, cluster visualization, and near real-time metrics collection. Skyscope is a React and Node.js application, packaged with Electron to work as a cross-platform desktop application. The design includes a timeseries metrics service for historic observability trends, built into the desktop app by default, yet capable of running as a standalone service if needed. The application design presented in this RFC is not set in stone, and submitting this RFC serves as a mechanism to gather community feedback about design decisions and implementation details before finalizing the architecture and feature set.

## Motivation

Valkey deployments face four primary observability challenges that impact operational efficiency and incident response times: 

1. _Monitoring visibility gaps_: `INFO` command and `COMMANDLOG` visibility gaps limiting command-level insights for root cause analysis. These gaps extend troubleshooting time and reduce operational effectiveness during performance incidents.

2. _Limited cluster visibility_: lack of real-time slot-level performance metrics makes it very challenging to assess resource allocation or identify when rebalancing actions are needed especially during scaling operations.

3. _Hot key detection_: current hot key detection approaches require either expensive full-cluster scans that impact production performance or relying on the Least Frequently Used (LFU) eviction policy, which some deployments are unable to configure.

4. _Operational complexity:_ Manual monitoring of clusters demands substantial engineering effort.

The Valkey community has identified these challenges through engagement on [observability GitHub issues](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20observability). [Issues #852](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/issues/852), [#2127](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/pull/2127), [#2128](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/issues/2128), and [#1880](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/issues/1880) in the Valkey repository demonstrate demand for slot level metrics and efficient hot key identification. Community analysis also shows preference for native observability features for enhanced observability with structured access to internal metrics, command statistics, and performance indicators. (i.e. [Issue #1167](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/issues/1167)).

Currently, no comprehensive observability solution exists that addresses these specific Valkey operational challenges in a unified interface. The Valkey community lacks a dedicated tool that combines near real-time monitoring, hot key detection, and cluster visualization tailored to Valkey's architecture and performance characteristics. This initiative fills the observability gap by providing a native solution designed for Valkey deployments, addressing the absence of purpose-built tooling in the current landscape.

## Design Considerations

Skyscope's architecture reflects lessons learned from the community and customer research. The application prioritizes solving top customer pain points with minimal overhead on monitored Valkey instances and comprehensive coverage from key-level to cluster-level insights. The community consistently favors built-in observability features and emphasizes minimal performance impact as a critical requirement, with [Issue #1167](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/issues/1167) discussions, including specific concerns about monitoring tools that impact production workloads. Skyscope addresses this by polling Valkey at configurable intervals to collect time-series metrics.

### Architecture Overview

The application proposes a modular, three-component architecture designed for performance, maintainability, and observability:

**1. Frontend:** Built with React and Redux, the frontend runs as a cross-platform desktop application using Electron. This provides a native desktop experience while leveraging familiar web technologies and avoiding browser limitations.

The frontend operates within the Electron renderer process and connects to the backend via WebSockets to receive near real-time metric updates and request historical data. It receives specific metric types (memory, Central Processing Unit (CPU)) and displays them in tables and charts. When users select a time range, the frontend sends a query over WebSocket and receives filtered data for visualization.

**2. Backend for the Frontend:** A Node.js process that runs locally alongside the frontend and communicates with Valkey instances over WebSockets. It manages connection state, basic authentication, and command execution, returning responses for features like the integrated Command Line Interface (CLI). 

The backend runs in the Electron main process and hosts a WebSocket server that manages subscriptions, streams live updates to the frontend, and handles historical queries. It communicates with the metrics server over a local or remote HTTP API, using basic authentication. For near real-time updates, the backend reads new entries from NDJSON files on disk, filters by metric type, and emits them to subscribed clients. For historical queries, it fetches rows from the API, filters by timestamp, buckets the results (e.g., per 5s or 1m), and sends them to the frontend.

**3. Timeseries Metrics Service:** This process supports historical trend analysis without introducing external dependencies. This component polls metrics from Valkey clusters or instances at configurable intervals, with default settings to be determined based on further testing and server load analysis. It writes data to efficient local storage, enabling time-series visualizations of CPU load, memory usage, hot keys, and hot slots. Future plans include the ability to store metrics in remote storage (such as S3 or a timeseries DB). While it runs locally by default, the service can also be deployed remotely.

The standalone metrics server connects directly to Valkey, polls metrics (like `MEMORY STATS`, `INFO CPU`, `COMMANDLOG`) at fixed intervals, and writes them to daily NDJSON files. It batches data to reduce I/O and includes retry and backoff mechanisms for resilience. Each API endpoint (`/memory`, `/cpu`, etc.) reads and returns recent NDJSON rows, supporting filtering by time in future extensions.

This architecture cleanly separates concerns: the metrics server collects and stores data, the backend handles communication and data shaping, and the frontend focuses on visualization and user interaction

### Data Collection

The primary goal of the metrics collection mechanism is to provide comprehensive observability with minimal impact on server performance. The implementation will evolve iteratively as testing continues across the full application.

The metrics service collects data using the `INFO`, `MEMORY STATS`, and `COMMANDLOG GET` commands, directly addressing community concerns around monitoring blind spots and the need for historical trend visualization.

For hot key detection in clusters, the service uses a two-phase approach that balances thoroughness with performance efficiency:

1. **Hot Slot Identification:** It first analyzes slot-level metrics already exposed by Valkey, focusing on four key dimensions: key count, CPU usage, network bytes in, and network bytes out. This initial analysis identifies performance hotspots at the slot level without requiring expensive `SCAN` operations across the entire cluster.

2. **Scoped Key Scanning:** It then performs targeted key scans within only the identified hot slots. This reduces the cost of expensive scan operations while preserving accuracy in hot key detection. The scan logic uses undocumented but functional capabilities in Valkey to isolate hot keys without requiring a full cluster scan, helping avoid performance degradation in production environments.

## Specification

### Metrics Dashboard and Analysis

The metrics dashboard is designed to close visibility gaps in Valkey’s `INFO`, `COMMANDLOG` outputs by using data collection with built-in retry logic to ensure completeness. For the MVP, we plan to surface 20–30 high-priority metrics based on customer feedback and operational relevance.

Feedback from the community, such as [[Issue #2065](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/issues/2065)], which requests I/O thread utilization in `INFO`, shows a clear need for deeper performance insights, especially in multi-threaded and containerized environments. The current Valkey `INFO` output lacks the detail needed for effective troubleshooting. Skyscope addresses this by collecting more comprehensive metrics, displayed in a table format that can be quickly narrowed using search and filter controls. This makes it easier to work with large sets of metrics and find specific data points without digging through multiple views.

The dashboard also visualizes historical trends, made possible by the timeseries data collected by the metrics service. If the connected instance is part of a larger cluster, the metrics for all relevant nodes will be consolidated into a single place. 

### Cluster Topology Visualization

Cluster visualization shows the topology of nodes and slot distribution with intuitive visual representation. It highlights master-replica topology and overlays slot assignments and load distribution with heat maps.

Visual heat maps (post MVP) highlight CPU and memory usage across cluster nodes, leveraging slot-level metrics. The visualization updates in near real-time as new data becomes available, providing immediate feedback on cluster performance characteristics. Historical tracking enables trend analysis of patterns over time, allowing builders to identify recurring performance issues and plan capacity adjustments. An alert mechanism provides configurable notifications for access pattern anomalies, with thresholds that can be adjusted based on application requirements and cluster characteristics.

### Hot Key Detection and Visualization

Hot key detection addresses one of the most critical customer requirements through the two-phase approach that balances accuracy with performance impact concerns. The implementation leverages the slot-level memory metrics proof-of-concept from [PR #2127](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/pull/2127), which demonstrates that accurate slot-level memory attribution is technically feasible but requires careful implementation to avoid performance impact. The community discussion in [Issue #852](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/issues/852) specifically requests metrics that can identify which slots consume the most memory, directly validating Skyscope's approach of identifying hot slots before scanning individual keys.

When a hot key detection cycle begins, the system first queries slot-level metrics across all cluster nodes to identify slots experiencing high activity across the four monitored dimensions. Slots exceeding configurable thresholds trigger the second phase, where targeted SCAN operations examine keys within those specific slots. This approach reduces the scanning scope from potentially millions of keys across the entire cluster, to hundreds or thousands of keys within identified hot slots.

We store hot key data in a structured format that includes timestamp, instance identifier, key name, access count, memory bytes, and slot identifier for analysis and correlation with cluster performance metrics. This data structure enables both near real-time monitoring and historical analysis, supporting capacity planning and performance optimization workflows.

### Community Engagement and Development Strategy

Skyscope development follows transparent open source practices with public GitHub repositories and community-driven feature prioritization. The RFC process ensures alignment with Valkey community standards and facilitates collaborative development with existing observability developers. Regular community engagement occurs through weekly Monday community meetings, public issue tracking, and early alpha releases for community testing.

The development team maintains active participation in Valkey discussions and coordinates with other observability projects to avoid duplication of effort and enable potential collaboration. Customer validation occurs through direct engagement with customers facing observability issues, providing visibility and visualization capabilities that address operational requirements while managing expectations about server-side functionality changes.
